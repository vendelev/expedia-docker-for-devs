== Lesson 7: Launch it and watch it fly

Since the beginning of this course we learn how to create images and how to run containers.
The last part of our journey is going to our deployment.

As we know, containers are an interesting solution to run an application but when comes the time to go to production we have to think about resiliency, monitoring etc.
In this lesson we going to talk specifically 2 cluster management solutions: Mesos/Marathon and Amazon ECS.

The goal is to deploy manually our application in both of these solutions.
Even if in _real life_ we would automate the deployment processes using each solutions API (like what Primer is doing for EWE).

NOTE: There are several other solutions like Kubernetes but we won't have the time work with them.

=== Mesos / Marathon

[quote, Mesos documentation]
Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

http://mesos.apache.org/[Mesos] allows developers to _see_ a cluster of machines as if it was a single machine.
It takes care of the downstream resource management.

Several frameworks have been developed on top of Mesos.
There is Cronos to work with distributed cron jobs and Marathon to run - docker - applications.

From a Expedia standpoint, we have the capability to deploy Docker container in a Marathon cluster in our datacenter (Chandler).
The whole cluster is part the https://confluence/display/ecptech/Stockyard[Stockyard project].

[quote, Stockyard confluence page]
Stockyard is ECP's platform for launching container-based applications - specifically using Docker. It provides a flat, scalable, robust platform powered by Apache Mesos.

The goal of us is going to be able to deploy a simple application into a marathon cluster.

NOTE: At this stage, you should already have a docker image published into the docker hub (otherwise have a look at the end of the lesson 0).

==== How to deploy in Marathon?

.The UI interface

You should be able to access https://marathon.stockyard.karmalab.net/ui/#/apps[Marathon UI] and see.

image::marathon-UI.png[align=center]

From this interface we are going to configure our awesome application.
At this stage an application represents a long-running service, of which there would be many instances running on multiple hosts.

Applications can be grouped to facilitate the maintenance.
And we are going to use the https://marathon.stockyard.karmalab.net/ui/#/group/%2Fcode-academy-docker4devs[code-academy-docker4devs group] for this lesson.

The next step is to create an application.
On the top right corner of the page there is a blue button "Create Application", let's click on it.

You should be able to see the following modal

image::new-app-modal.png[align=center]

As our application is very simple we won't tweak the parameter to much.

For the ID (the name of our application), are going to follow this pattern `/code-academy-docker4devs/<YOUR USERNAME>-<NAME OF YOUR APP>`

For example as my application is simply named `nginx`, the ID will then `/code-academy-docker4devs/gscheibel-nginx`.

Under the `Docker container` section we are going to provide 2 information:
- Image: the full name of your image (including tag if needed), as you would use for a `docker pull` command (in my case `gscheibel/expedia-docker-for-devs:nginx`)
- Network: Select bridge to facilitate port mapping

For the port mapping section, as we have selected a `Bridge` strategy all we have to do is to provide the ports exposed by the container and Marathon will then assign a host port.
Following the example, my `nginx` container is listening (and exposing) its port 80 so the configuration will simply be:

image::port-exposing.png[align=center]

Finally, but optional, we can add some health check capability to our application.
For example, I know if send an HTTP request to my application targeting `/` (root path) and it responds under 300ms then the application is "healthy".
Go to the `Health Check` section to add this capability.
It's important when you want Marathon to auto scale your application.

Everything seem to be OK, then image:create-app.png[]

After some time, your application should be marked as `Running`.
If you have added an health check, it will mark it (normally) as `healthy`.

Looking overall like

image::up-and-running.png[align=center]

==== How to test my application?

For this lesson, we are not going to do any load balancer or DNS management so we going to hit the host directly.
Under the `Instances` tab, you have all the running instances of your application.

If you look carefully there is a link under your application instance ID

In this example

image::marathon-instance.png[align=center]

The instance ID is `code-academy-docker4devs_gscheibel-nginx.9379f2ef-13f4-11e7-99bf-1402ec34bda8` while the exposed endpoint is `chlxmesosslv007.karmalab.net:31212`.

You can click on the endpoint to access your application directly.

NOTE: By default the endpoint link uses HTTPS, don't forget to change it if your application only support HTTP.

IF everything correctly we can expect:

=== Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)

:cluster-name: codeacademy-docker4devs

Another way to deploy container is by using https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon EC2 Container Service] aka ECS.

In a nutshell ECS is

[quote, ECS landing page]
Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

For this course we are going to focus on deploying 1 container in ECS.
To do that the first step is to log into the https://aws-sso.tools.expedia.com[AWS console] with your SEA credentials.
Then select the `EWEDEV_Admins` account.

As you can imaging we are going to focus only on the ECS part of AWS.
And to dive into it, let's go to the ECS console by selecting the ECS service in the search bar:

image::ecs-portal.png[align=center]

Once in the ECS page, you should be able to see a list of ECS cluster (group of EC2 instances used to deploy containers).
Today we will be using `{cluster-name}`.

But before looking deeper into the cluster, let's have a look at another concept called `Task`.

==== Task definitions

A task describes a set of information regarding how to run an application.
It's fairly similar to what we did with Docker Compose in the previous lessons.

Go to the `Task Definitions` and click on `Create new Task Definition`.

In our case our task definition will have the following characteristics:

* Task definition name => use `<USERNAME>-<APP-NAME>` (eg gscheibel-nginx)
* Task role: empty
* Network Mode: Bridge

Then add a container, which would look like:

* Container name: whatever you want to
* Image: the complete name as you would use to perform a `docker pull` (eg: `gscheibel/expedia-docker-for-devs:nginx`)
* Memory limit: 128MB would be enough
* Port mapping:
** Host: something between 49201 and 49300
** Container: the port exposed by your application (like 80 for a default HTTP routing)

That would be enough even if we could easily add more informations with environment variable, labels etc.

Once the container has been added, your Task definition should look like:

image::create-task-definition.png[align=center]

NOTE: Tasks are versioned, which is helpful for some maintenance and evolutions

==== Deploying

Now we have our task created, let's go back to our {cluster-name} cluster and https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-west-2#/clusters/codeacademy-docker4devs/runTask[run a task].

First select the task definition you've just created (the `:1` means it's the first version).
Select the {cluster-name} cluster leave the rest as is.

image::run-task.png[align=center]

And after a bit of time the task should be `RUNNING`

image::task-running.png[align=center]

==== Testing in production

Now our application is running let's try to ping it.
For the purpose of this course, there is no "advanced" network like load balancer or domain name.
And to simplify the exercise we only use 1 shared EC2 instance.

To reach our application we are going to use the public DNS entry (pre-set by AWS) being: `ec2-54-202-95-72.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`.

As my `gscheibel-nginx` container has been mapped to port `49200` (in my Task definition) I can simply do:

[source]

$ curl ec2-54-202-95-72.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:49200/expedia.html

NOTE: The office network restriction blocks most of the request on "non-standard" port, if it doesn't work re-try while being connected to the corporate VPN.
