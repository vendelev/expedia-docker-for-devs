== Lesson 2: The Dockerfile

=== A quick recap about Docker Images

A Docker Images is made up of filesystems layered over each other.
At the base there is a boot filesystem, _bootfs_, on top of it there is the _rootfs_, our Operation System (eg. Debian).
At this point we can add other layers to compose our final _image_, each of this layers are _read-only_ images.
When we finally run our container (_docker run <image name>_), we are just adding a new _read-write_ layer on top of our _read-only_ layers pile.

In lesson 1 we built our _image_ using the _docker commit_ command.
This approach can be useful for quick tests or to apply minor changes to an existing _image_, but generally when we start building more complex images we have a better option.

In this lesson we are going to learn how to generate a Docker image starting from a *Dockerfile*.
A _Dockerfile_ is a simple text file using a basic DSL (Domain Specific Language).
This approach is usually recommended because it provides a more repeatable mechanism to create images.

=== Dockerfile and images

A Dockerfile is effectively a text file describing a set of instructions to execute when the image is being built.
All the instructions are following the same syntax:

[source]
----
# Comment
INSTRUCTION arguments
----

The first instruction *must* be `FROM`.
It specifies which base image your are building from.

For example building a custom image out of the `debian:jessie-slim` one would be:

[source]
include::dockerfiles/firstBuild[]

Previously to create a new image, we used `commit`.
Now we are going to use the `build` one.

[TIP]
--
Have a look the helper for that command.
And more specifically at the `-f` and `-t` options, they will be useful.
--

.Exercise
Build with a tag (of your choice) a docker image based on `debian:latest`.
Then look up into your local set of images if you can find it.

.Expected output
Once you ran that command, you should be able to see something like

:firstBuildID: 7d86024f45a4
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
Sending build context to Docker daemon 6.144 kB
Step 1/1 : FROM debian:jessie-slim
 ---> {firstBuildID}
Successfully built {firstBuildID}
----

By running a `docker images` we can check the new image is there

[source]
----
docker images

debian  jessie-slim     7d86024f45a4   4 weeks ago   80 MB
firstfromfile  latest   7d86024f45a4   4 weeks ago   80 MB
----

NOTE: As our image is exactly the same as the base one, the ID is the same.

include::solutions.adoc[tags=firstBuild]

Let people know who is maintaining the image and its Dockerfile by adding a label.
To do so, we can add a label to our image.

The `LABEL` instruction add a set of key-value pairs to the image.
Labels are like comments for the the image itself.
Images can have several labels and their content can be any strings.

.Exercise
Add a label named `maintainer` with your name to your docker image and rebuild it.

.Expected output
Now we should be able to see a new step in the building process.

[source]
----
Sending build context to Docker daemon 1.386 MB
Step 1/2 : FROM debian:jessie-slim
 ---> 7d86024f45a4
Step 2/2 : LABEL maintainer Guillaume Scheibel <gscheibel@expedia.com>
 ---> Running in 44623b0480c1
 ---> bc7f87bedbc5
Removing intermediate container 44623b0480c1
Successfully built bc7f87bedbc5 <1>
----

<1> As we add a new step, we get a new image ID.

NOTE: To look at the labels, run the `inspect` command.

include::solutions.adoc[tags=withMaintainer]

=== Let's build up our images

To customize an image from a Dockerfile, there are several interesting instruction to know.

==== How to `RUN` a command at build time?

The https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/run[RUN] instruction will run any command on the current layer and commit it.
By default all the command are running in as `/bin/sh -c` command.

The instruction has 2 forms:

[source]
----
RUN <command> <1>
RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] <2>
----

<1> This form only run the <command> in a `sh` shell
<2> If you want to run a command like `/bin/bash -c <doSomething>`, use that form (`RUN ["/bin/bash", "-c", "<doSomething>"]`).

.Exercise
Add a new layer by creating a `logs` folder under `/opt` and build the image.

.Expected output
As we add a new layer, we expect to get a new step and a new ID.

[source]
----
Sending build context to Docker daemon 1.389 MB
Step 1/3 : FROM debian:jessie-slim
 ---> 7d86024f45a4
Step 2/3 : LABEL maintainer Guillaume Scheibel <gscheibel@expedia.com>
 ---> Using cache <1>
 ---> bc7f87bedbc5
Step 3/3 : RUN mkdir /opt/logs <2>
 ---> Running in f4f814acbd73
 ---> 35e492fc1c49
Removing intermediate container f4f814acbd73
Successfully built 35e492fc1c49
----

<1> As this step as not been modified, there is no need to rebuild it and it can be reused from the cache directly which speeds up the build process
<2> Our new instruction

include::solutions.adoc[tags=mkdirLogs]

===== How to customize the execution of the container?

By default, base image such as debian run a `/bin/bash` at startup time.
We can customize that by using the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/cmd[CMD] instruction.

When the container starts, it will run this command.
For example, if you have a container running a web server like Tomcat.
Your Dockerfile will at first describe how to install Tomcat then at the end, `CMD` will run the `startup.sh` script.

NOTE: There can be only 1 `CMD` instruction. If the Dockerfile contains several of them, only the *last* one will be executed.

.Exercise
Create an image which follows those requirements:

. Based on debian
. Refers to you as the maintainer
. Creates an logs folders under `/opt`
. Add a file in this newly created folder
. List the content of the `/opt/logs` at runtime

Then run a container based on that image.

.Expected output
The content of the `/opt/logs` folder (with the file you created step 4).

include::solutions.adoc[tags=withCMD]

===== What about environment variable?

Of course we can use variables to avoid repeating ourselves in the Dockerfile.
The https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/env[ENV] instruction let you declare an environment variable.

The syntax is very simple `ENV key value`.
Then to use the variable you have 2 syntaxes `$key` or `${key}`.

.Exercise
Based on the previous exercise, put file name in a variable and reuse it afterward.

.Expected output
Pretty much the same as the previous exercise.
