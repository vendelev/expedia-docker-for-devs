== Lesson 0: Introduction

=== Docker vs Virtual Machines

You may wondering why you should learn Docker when you already know what is a VM and how to use it to encapsulate and run an application.

When you create a VM you need to emulate every component of the machine, you should install a full OS and you should configure it to run your service.
Of course you can use provisioning tools but is still time consuming, resource heavy and, most of all, it doesn't feel good when you are building micro services.

Docker uses all the resources of your host machine and it just creates an isolated filesystem (using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS[UFS]) where to run your service.
This approach is lighter and much faster.
Of course there are other cool features of Docker that make it a great tool, but will go through them during this course.

If you want more details about the differences between Docker and VMs you could read https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/containers-are-not-vms/[this] or https://devops.com/docker-vs-vms/[this] articles.

==== Docker registry

=== Set up

If you don't have docker installed yet, go to the Docker page https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/[for Mac] or https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/[for Windows] and download the installation file.
The easiest way then is to follow the steps provided on the page (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/\#step-1-install-and-run-docker-for-mac[for Mac] or https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/\#/step-1-install-docker-for-windows[for Windows]).

=== Is my set up completed?

As mentioned in the official page, you should be able to a Docker icon (a small whale) in your top status bar.

From a new terminal, you should be able to run the following commands:

[source]
docker --version

And have something similar to `Docker version 1.12.5, build 7392c3b` as an output.

TIP: You can easily install Docker command completion by following https://docs.docker.com/compose/completion/#/bash[this] steps

=== Pulling Docker images
For this course, we are going to use mostly the Debian base image.

.Exercise
Download the latest Debian docker image from the official registry.

TIP: if you don't remember which command to run, have a look the helper via `docker help`

.Expected output
[source]
----
Using default tag: latest <1>
latest: Pulling from library/debian
75a822cd7888: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:f7062cf040f67f0c26ff46b3b44fe036c29468a7e69d8170f37c57f2eec1261b
Status: Downloaded newer image for debian:latest
----

<1> As we haven't specified a specific version, Docker downloads the `latest` one

include::solutions.adoc[tags=downloadDebian]

==== Tags

Each docker image can be tagged with a string.
The tag is used as a version number.
Every docker image can be represented with a tag, the naming convention is then `<image name>:<tag>`.
The default tag is `latest`.

.Exercise
Download the debian image tagged `jessie-slim`

.Expected output
[source]
----
jessie-slim: Pulling from library/debian
1a095986e25e: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:facf8d92aeeeaff4f57d9af5897330430ebdc0cfc95d7855a0bdf9f0ff8af410
Status: Downloaded newer image for debian:jessie-slim
----

=== Running a container

A container is to an image what the cake is to a recipe.
Now we know the recipe to create a "debian cake" let's bake!

Effectively, running container means running a command in a new container.
Containers are running a Linux environment, so run a good old bash.

To start a new container we are going to use the `run` command.
The structure of the command is the following `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`.

TIP: As usual, to get more help we can always use `docker [COMMAND] --help` which would be `docker run --help` in this case.

.Exercise
Run the `/bin/bash` command, in a new `debian` container.
What does happen?

include::solutions.adoc[tags=firstRun]

[[run-debian-bash, Run bash in Debian exercise]]
.Exercise
Run a new debian container (with a bash session) as before but attach a terminal to it
What does happen this time?

include::solutions.adoc[tags=secondRun]

=== Which containers are running?

How to get the list of running processes from the command line?
You would probably answer the _ps_ command and you would be right.
Docker has the same command.

.Exercise
While you have a bash session running in a container (see the <<run-debian-bash>>).
Open another terminal and list the current running containers.

include::solutions.adoc[tags=runningContainers]

=== Container's filesystem

What does happen when in a VM you delete the `/bin`?
You pray there is a snapshot somewhere!

In the container world, each container is independent and non-persistent.
It means if you're running a container, you can delete some part of the filesystem and you'll still be able to create new instances of the image.
The corollary is, if you create a file locally and start container, your file won't be there.

.Exercise
Take a running debian container.
Delete some files (like /media for instance).
In another terminal, start a container of the same type

include::solutions.adoc[tags=deleteFiles]

.Exercise
In a container, create or delete a file but this time restart the container instead of creating a new one.

TIP: Have a look at `docker restart` and `docker exec`
